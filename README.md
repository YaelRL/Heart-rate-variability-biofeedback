# Heart-rate-variability-biofeedback
Aim- This study’s goal was to investigate the effect of a biofeedback stress reduction intervention on pain among people with chronic low back pain.

Methods- Heart rate variability (HRV) was used to assess autonomic function, with high HRV indicating high activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (low stress levels) and low HRV indicating dominance of the sympathetic nervous system (high stress levels).
Participants practiced with HRV biofeedback for up to 12 weeks in order to down-regulate their sympathetic nervous system and lower their stress levels. We tested the efficacy of this biofeedback training program, and the hypothesis that stress levels mediate the intervention’s effect on pain levels.

Results- Pain decreased over time, mostly during the first 3 weeks and for people with a high baseline pain level (7-10/10), but no statistically significant correlation was found between the intervention and pain. In addition, stress was not a statistically significant mediator of the effect of the intervention on pain.

Conclusions- further research is warranted due to design and analysis limitations.
